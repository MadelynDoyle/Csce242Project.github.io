      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Palmetto Fresh Meats is a family owned and operated company based in Aynor, SC.
        Our meat is locally grown within South Carolina! The owners John and Jeanne Doyle
        have been in the cattle business since the 80s and have recently moved into the
        butcher business! We offer hog and cattle processing, and we also dry age our beef
        for the best tasting experience!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at Palmetto Fresh Meats we believe in the quality of the products our customers
        are getting. John, Jeanne, as well as their whole family have been eating their high
        quality homegrown beef all their lives. It was important to them to give back to the
        community and having fresh meats available is how they have decided to do just that.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a USDA custom meat processor. What that means is that everyday onsite there is
        a federal inspector shadowing every part of the process. This ensures that all of our
        employees are up to par with federal codes.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Palmetto Fresh Meats, we’re not just committed to freshness, we’re committed to family,
        community, and supporting local farmers. We pride ourselves on providing trustworthy service
        and premium cuts every time.
